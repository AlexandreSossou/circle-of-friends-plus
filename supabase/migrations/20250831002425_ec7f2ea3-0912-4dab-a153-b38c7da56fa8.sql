-- Security Fix: Address User ID and Personal Information Exposure

-- 2. UPDATE RLS POLICIES

-- Fix Group Members - CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view group memberships" ON group_members;

-- Replace with secure policies that only show memberships for groups user has access to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view group memberships for groups they can see" 
ON group_members 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  -- User can see memberships in groups they're members of
  group_id IN (
    SELECT gm.group_id 
    FROM group_members gm 
    WHERE gm.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  OR 
  -- User can see memberships in public groups they can view
  group_id IN (
    SELECT g.id 
    FROM groups g 
    WHERE g.is_public = true
  )
);

-- Create policy for viewing basic membership info in public groups (without exposing user details)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view limited group membership data"
ON group_members
FOR SELECT  
USING (
  -- Only for public groups and only expose limited info
  group_id IN (SELECT id FROM groups WHERE is_public = true)
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL -- Must be authenticated
);

-- 3. UPDATE EXISTING POLICIES TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE

-- Events: Update public events policy to not expose user_id directly
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view public events" ON events;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public events with limited creator info"
ON events
FOR SELECT
USING (
  visibility = 'public' 
  AND (
    -- Own events show full data
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR
    -- Others see limited data through the safe function
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  )
);

-- Announcements: Update public announcements policy  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view public announcements" ON announcements;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public announcements with limited author info"  
ON announcements
FOR SELECT
USING (
  visibility = 'public'
  AND (
    -- Own announcements show full data
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR  
    -- Others see limited data
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  )
);

-- Groups: Update public groups policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view public groups" ON groups;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public groups with limited creator info"
ON groups  
FOR SELECT
USING (
  is_public = true
  AND (
    -- Members and creators see full data
    id IN (SELECT group_id FROM group_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
    OR created_by = auth.uid()
    OR
    -- Others see limited data  
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  )
);

-- 4. ADD ADDITIONAL SECURITY POLICIES

-- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive group member data
CREATE POLICY "Restrict group member role visibility"
ON group_members
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Only show roles to group members and admins
  user_id = auth.uid() 
  OR group_id IN (
    SELECT gm.group_id 
    FROM group_members gm 
    WHERE gm.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  OR EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM group_members gm 
    WHERE gm.group_id = group_members.group_id 
    AND gm.user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND gm.role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Add rate limiting context for security monitoring
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.log_security_access(
  table_name text,
  access_type text,
  user_id uuid DEFAULT auth.uid()
)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql

  -- This can be expanded for security monitoring
  -- For now, just ensure function exists for future use
